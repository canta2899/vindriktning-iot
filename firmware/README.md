# Sensor firmware

This directory contains a PlatformIO project with the custom firmware that needs to be uploaded to the customized sensors in order to allow them to connect to the network and send regular messages to the MQTT broker. The code is heavily inspired by [Hypfer's work](https://github.com/Hypfer/esp8266-vindriktning-particle-sensor)
